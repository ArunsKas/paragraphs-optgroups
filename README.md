# paragraphs-optgroups
Add optgroups to Drupal Paragraphs select lists.

## Usage

Paragraphs Optgroups creates groups based on how you name your paragraph bundles. Your paragraph bundle names should follow the convention of `Category Name - Component Name`

This will create a select list like the following:

- ***Category Name***
  - Component Name
  - Component Name
  - Component Name
- ***Second Category***
  - Component Name
  - Component Name
  - Component Name
  
Paragraph bundles that do not follow that convention will be automatically put in a "Miscellaneous" group.
